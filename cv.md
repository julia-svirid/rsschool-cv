### Summary:

### Code examples:
#### Here's one of my tasks from [Codewars](www.codewars.com):

function duplicateCount(text){
  let str = text.toLowerCase();
  let arr = str.split('');
  arr.sort();

  let temp = [];
  for (let i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
      if (arr[i]==arr[i+1]) {
        temp.push(arr[i]);
      }    
  }
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i<temp.length; i++){
    if (!result.includes(temp[i])) {
      result.push(temp[i]);
  }
}
let count = result.length;
return count;
}
```
